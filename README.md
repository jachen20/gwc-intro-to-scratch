# Intro to Scratch!

## What is Scratch?

Scratch is what I would call a block based programming language. A single block can contain a instruction to say "hello" or to walk 5 blocks. When you drag and connect these blocks together, you can create a list of instructions to give to the community and that's what writing code is all about! It's an interactive and fun way to code! You can create digital stories, games, and animation with Scratch.

Here's the Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/

## Signing up for Scratch

First, we'll set up an account with Scratch so you can come back to your projects anytime!

## Making the cat say, "Hello, world!"

You should see a green flag and a red stop button above the cat.

The green flag stands for GO and the red stop stands for STOP. We want to make it so when we click the green flag, the cat says "hello, world". Go to the Events section and drag this block into the center:

Next, go to the Sound section and drag this block right underneath the first one:

We'll change "Hello!" into "Hello, world!"

Press the green flag, and your cat should say "Hello, world!"
