# Intro to Scratch!

## What is Scratch?

Scratch is what I would call a block based programming language. A single block can contain a instruction to say "hello" or to walk 5 blocks. When you drag and connect these blocks together, you can create a list of instructions to give to the community and that's what writing code is all about! It's an interactive and fun way to code! You can create digital stories, games, and animation with Scratch.

Here's the Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/
